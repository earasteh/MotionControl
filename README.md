# Motion Control Project
:warning: **This repo is a not complete yet and is a work-in-progress** :warning:


This is a repo related to EHC 267 - Nonlinear Control class project at UC Davis, Winter 2022.
The animation part and a few class definitions are taken from: https://github.com/winstxnhdw/KinematicBicycleModel


## Abstract
This project is using model predictive control to follow a trajectory for an autonomous vehicle. The simulated vehicle
include a 7 DoF vehicle model with algebraic normal forces and Pacjeka tire model.
The trajectory following also includes the original Stanley controller and a PID controller for the longitudinal control.
